## Welcome to the Arctic Meeting for Adaptive Mechanisms in Biological Systems, 
Venue: Abisko, Sweden
Time: January 19-23, 2026

oin us in Abisko, Sweden, January 19–23, 2026, for a scientific adventure in the heart of the Arctic. This meeting brings together researchers from physics, biology, mathematics, and ecology to explore how living systems adapt to stress, from molecular regulation to ecosystem resilience. The conference is part of the Swedish–Korean STINT collaboration and is jointly organized with the Integrated Science Lab (IceLab) at Umeå University.

Stress Response Modeling at IceLab is a multidisciplinary complexity center that aims to reveal universal principles of adaptation and stability in living systems under stress. Its research spans three pillars: empirical knowledge across scales, network inference for prediction, and dynamical systems modeling to explain stability, resilience, and tipping points. This meeting continues that mission by combining science, collaboration, and Arctic exploration.
