Ludvig has been an icelab group leader since 2011. He is interested in problems at the interphase between physics and cell biology, combining simulations and analytical work. 

Before becoming an associate professor at the physics department in Umeå, Ludvig worked as a postdoc together with prof. [Alexander Grosberg](https://physics.nyu.edu/Grosberg/) at New York University. There, Ludvig got to know about the DNA folding problem which today is a large part of his research. Before moving to New York, Ludvig was a postdoc in prof. Kim Sneppen’s lab, [Center for Models of Life](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/research/biocomplexity/cmol/), at the Niels Bohr institute (Copenhagen, Denmark). There he worked on various problems such as evolution of metabolic networks in bacteria, protein aggregation in cells, molecular crowding in one dimensional systems (such as protein diffusion along DNA), and information spreading in social systems. Ludvig did his undergraduate and PhD studies at Chalmers University (Gothenburg, Sweden) where he modeled reaction-diffusion processes in nanofluidic networks.
