LizanaLab conducts groundbreaking research in epigenetics, chromosome organization, gene regulation, and aging. They develop epigenetic clocks to measure biological age and explore interventions for abnormal aging. The team investigates histone methylation dynamics and the role of Polycomb complexes in gene expression. Their innovative network analysis methods reveal the principles of 3D chromosome folding and its impact on transcription and DNA repair. By combining computational modeling, theoretical approaches, and experimental data, LizanaLab advances our understanding of these vital biological processes, offering potential insights for future therapies.
