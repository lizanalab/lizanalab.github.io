The life sciences have witnessed an unprecedented surge in data, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and imaging technologies. While statistical and machine-learning approaches have provided valuable insights, they often lack the ability to unveil cause-and-effect relationships. Therefore, our group takes a different approach; we specialize in developing mechanistic models that integrate diverse datasets, offering deeper insights into biological processes and enhancing the reliability of predictions.

In collaboration with experimentalists, we tackle a wide array of topics, including biological networks, gene regulation, epigenetics, aging, intermittent search problems, polymer physics, and DNA folding in the cell nucleus. Additionally, we engage in interdisciplinary collaborations with earth scientists, employing network models to calculate CO2 emissions in the Arctic.
