Antón began his studies in physics in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, in northern Spain. During an Erasmus exchange in Umeå, Sweden, he developed a deep connection with the city, drawn in by its winter landscapes and natural surroundings. After that experience, he decided to stay in Umeå to study a master’s degree in physics. During his studies, Antón became increasingly interested in modeling systems beyond the traditional scope of physics.

Now pursuing his PhD, Antón works on developing mechanistic models of biological processes, focusing specifically on DNA methylation and its role in gene regulation. Through his research, he aims to understand better how this process influences aging and the development of diseases.

Outside the lab, you’ll often find him cross-country skiing in winter or hiking in the summer. He also practices Brazilian jiu-jitsu and enjoys spending time with a good book.
